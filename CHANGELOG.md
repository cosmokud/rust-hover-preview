# Changelog

## [0.2.5] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Archive previews: hovering a `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz` — and the zip containers `.zipx`, `.jar`, `.apk`, `.xpi` and `.cbz` — shows a summary line and a capped tree of what the archive holds, with folders first, each file's size right-aligned, and `… and N more items` when the page runs out of room. Nothing is unpacked: only the archive's own table of contents is read, so a five-gigabyte archive previews as fast as a small one.
- `archive_preview_enabled` and an `[archive] extensions` list in `config.ini`, and an `Archives` entry in the tray's `Toggle Preview Types` submenu. The list is editable, so a container it does not name can be added.
- Archive listings are painted with the same themes, fonts and margins as text previews and follow the `Text Preview Font Size` setting; switching theme or font size redraws an open listing.

### Changed

- The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.88, which is the `zip` crate's floor.
- The GDI painting a text preview and an archive listing share moved into `text_paint.rs`; text previews are unchanged by it.
- Archive listings keep room between an entry's icon and its name instead of drawing the two against each other.
- RAR archives are read through RARLAB's UnRAR sources compiled in by the `unrar` crate. See the licence note in README.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `image_cache_mb` in `config.ini` (default `64`) sets how much memory decoded image previews may be kept in, so hovering back over a folder no longer decodes the same pictures again. `0` turns the cache off, and the value is capped at `2048`.

### Changed

- The preview thread no longer wakes on a timer while nothing is on screen: it waits on the hover channel instead, so an idle app stops waking sixty times a second, and a hover is answered as it arrives rather than on the next tick.
- Animated GIF, APNG and WebP previews open on their first frames instead of waiting for a startup buffer.
- Video previews read a file's dimensions and detect its letterboxing at the same time instead of one after the other.
- A PDF's page size is remembered from the render that read it, so a file is not opened twice for one preview.
- Bumped version to 0.2.4 in Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock

### Fixed

- A PDF is no longer read into memory in full before its first page is rendered, so a large one costs memory in proportion to the page rather than to the file.
- A OneDrive or SharePoint file that has not been downloaded no longer starts downloading when the pointer rests on it.
- A very large image can no longer take the app down with it.
- Hovering no longer stalls indefinitely when Explorer stops answering.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- Hover previews in a search results view are resolved from the item under the pointer instead of its file name, so a search of any size previews as fast as a folder does.
- Keyboard previews resolve the same way, from the item the focus is on.
- Removed the name-based fallbacks and the search-result indexing behind them: no directory walks, no background scans, no index caches, no MSAA.
- A file nothing can vouch for is left without a preview rather than guessed at by name.
- Documentation updated: ARCHITECTURE.md describes the resolution, and the search-results known issue is gone from TODO.md.
- Text previews wrap long lines instead of cutting them off at the right edge.

### Fixed

- A text preview of a file with long lines is now tall enough to show the rows the line wraps into, instead of cutting them off below the first one.
- Search results that share a file name each preview their own file.
- A search result that lives in another folder previews from the keyboard too, not only under the pointer.
- A Details or Content row previews from anywhere on it, not only from its text.
- A keyboard preview of a Content view row is placed in the empty tail past the row's last column — the edge the row's own text stops at, read from the view — instead of in the middle of the display, and the space to the right of the columns is what sizes it.
- A search result previews in any tab of an Explorer window, and follows the tab when it changes.
- Hovering a folder, an executable or any other item this app does not preview no longer shows another tab's file.
- Bumped version to 0.2.3 in Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
